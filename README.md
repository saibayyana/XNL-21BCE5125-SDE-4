XNL-21BCE5125-SDE-4: Extreme Database Design, Scalability & Query Optimization for Fintech
Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a highly scalable, ACID-compliant database for a multi-vendor fintech platform. It involves schema design, query optimization, and performance benchmarking for real-time financial analytics on large datasets.

Key Features
Scalable Database Schema optimized for high transaction volumes
Efficient Query Performance using indexing, partitioning, and refactoring
Synthetic Data Generation for simulating real-world scenarios
Performance Benchmarking with before-and-after query optimizations
Comprehensive Documentation covering design, implementation, and testing
Database Schema
Entities: Users, Vendors, Transactions, Market Data, Audits
Relationships: Users interact with Vendors, transactions are audited, and market data updates dynamically
ER Diagram: Available in /diagrams/ER_Diagram.png
Data Population
Synthetic data generated using SQL scripts and Python Faker
Millions of records simulate real-time fintech transactions
Detailed process documentation in /docs/Data_Generation.md
Query Development & Optimization
Queries for real-time sales trends, top-performing vendors, and fraud detection
Optimizations using indexes, partitions, and query refactoring
Performance benchmarking with EXPLAIN ANALYZE reports
Performance Testing
Stress testing queries on large datasets
Execution time and memory usage comparisons
